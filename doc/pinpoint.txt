INTRODUCTION					*pinpoint*

Does your project have enough files to lag ctrlp? Look no further

COMMANDS					*pinpoint-commands*

						*:Bufedit*
:Bufe[dit] {pattern}	Enter/narrow down a pattern, using the popup window for
			instant feedback on which buffer will be selected.

						*:Bufsplit*
:Bufs[plit] {pattern}	Like |:Bufedit|, but open the buffer in a horizontal split.

						*:Bufvsplit*
:Bufvs[plit] {pattern}	Like |:Bufedit|, but open the buffer in a vertical split.

						*:Buftabedit*
:Buft[abedit] {pattern} Like |:Bufedit|, but open the buffer in a new tab.

:Fe[dit] {pattern}	Like |:Bufedit|, but incrementally complete a file path,
			presenting new files each time a directory (`/`) is entered.

						*:Fsplit*
:Fs[plit] {pattern}	Like |:Fedit|, but open the file in a horizontal split.

						*:Fvsplit*
:Fv[split] {pattern}	Like |:Fedit|, but open the file in a vertical split.

:Olds[plit] {pattern}	Like |:Oldedit|, but open the oldfile in a horizontal split.

SETTINGS					*pinpoint-settings*

 *g:pinpoint_preview_delay*	Delay before populating the preview - useful if
				vim lags on inital character entry

 *g:pinpoint_preview_colour*	Display preview in colour, as opposed to underlines
				showing which parts of the filename match your search.

 *g:pinpoint_preview_fullwords*   Rather than matching "abc/xyz" against "*a*b*c*/*x*y*z*",
				match it against "*abc*/*xyz*"

 *g:pinpoint_fuzzy*		Use vim/neovim's builtin |matchfuzzy()| function - colour
				highlighting can't be done in this mode, but it may be
				more performance than the native vimscript matching.


MAPS					*pinpoint-maps*

CTRL-B		Convert a command from |:e|/|:vs|/|:sp|/|:tabe| to the equivalent |:Fedit|,
		or convert a |:b| to |:Bufedit|

						*META-P*
